Camplify is a web application for viewing, posting, and reviewing campgrounds. The campgrounds page presents visitors with a grid
of cards containing the posted campgrounds. Visitors can click the "more info" link on the cards to visit the campground's show page,
which presents additional information about the campground. Authenticated users are able to post new campgrounds and submit campground
reviews. Authorized users are able to edit and delete their own campgrounds and reviews.

Camplify is based on the final project for Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy. In this project, I've been able to implement
the various technologies I've learned throughout this course. Camplify employs the following technologies:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB / MongoDB Atlas
  - EJS Templating for generating HTML
  - CSS / Bootstrap
  - jQuery
  - Passport
For a full list of the Node packages used by Camplify, please view the package.json file.
